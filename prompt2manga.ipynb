Problem Statement\n","\n","Creating a short manga or comic usually requires:\n","- Character design\n","- Story writing\n","- Dialog scripting\n","- Panel-wise illustration\n","- Layout and publishing\n","\n","Doing this manually is time-consuming and requires multiple skills (writer, artist, designer).\n","\n","## 2. Solution Overview\n","\n","**Prompt2Manga** is an AI-powered, **Sequential Multi-Agent System** that converts a simple user prompt into a **5-page manga PDF**.\n","\n","Given a user prompt (e.g., *\"Create a 5-page manga about a robot who learns human emotions\"*), the system:\n","\n","1. Generates characters and their traits  \n","2. Builds a story outline  \n","3. Converts the story into a panel-wise script  \n","4. Generates images using a diffusion model  \n","5. Compiles everything into a final manga PDF\n","\n","All of this runs inside a **single Kaggle notebook**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Key Features (Course Concepts Used)\n","\n","This project demonstrates multiple agentic / GenAI concepts:\n","\n","- ✅ **Sequential Multi-Agent Pipeline**  \n","  Each agent focuses on one task and passes structured output to the next agent.\n","\n","- ✅ **LLM-Orchestrated Workflow**  \n","  Gemini (or LLM) is used to:\n","  - Generate characters\n","  - Plan the story\n","  - Write dialog/script\n","\n","- ✅ **Tool-Using Agent**  \n","  One sub-agent triggers image generation using a **Stable Diffusion pipeline** (tool use).\n","\n","- ✅ **Automated Document Generation**  \n","  A final “publisher agent” composes images and text into a **multi-page manga PDF**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. High-Level Architecture\n","\n","The system has the following agents:\n","\n","1. **Character Agent**  \n","   - Input: User prompt  \n","   - Output: List of characters with names, roles, and personality traits.\n","\n","2. **Story Agent**  \n","   - Input: User prompt + character list  \n","   - Output: Story outline divided into pages and panels.\n","\n","3. **Script Agent**  \n","   - Input: Story outline  \n","   - Output: Panel-wise script including dialogues and scene descriptions.\n","\n","4. **Illustration Agent**  \n","   - Input: Panel descriptions  \n","   - Output: Panel images generated using Stable Diffusion.\n","\n","5. **Publisher Agent**  \n","   - Input: Script + images  \n","   - Output: A **5-page PDF** saved as `final_manga_comic.pdf`.\n","\n","Data flows in a **linear sequence**:  \n","**User Prompt → Character Agent → Story Agent → Script Agent → Illustration Agent → Publisher Agent**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Architecture Diagram (Logical View)\n","\n","You can visualize the system like this:\n","\n","**User Prompt**  \n","⬇  \n","**Character Agent** → Characters JSON  \n","⬇  \n","**Story Agent** → Story Outline (pages + panels)  \n","⬇  \n","**Script Agent** → Panel Script (dialog + descriptions)  \n","⬇  \n","**Illustration Agent** → Panel Images  \n","⬇  \n","**Publisher Agent** → 📄 `final_manga_comic.pdf`\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. Technologies Used\n","\n","- **Language Model**: Gemini (or compatible LLM)\n","- **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion (Diffusers)\n","- **PDF Creation**: FPDF\n","- **Runtime**: Kaggle Notebook (Python)\n","- **Hardware**: GPU (T4) for faster image generation\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. How to Run (Kaggle Setup)\n","\n","1. **Enable GPU**\n","   - Go to **Settings → Accelerator → GPU (T4)**\n","\n","2. **Install Dependencies** (run the setup cell)\n","   - `diffusers`, `transformers`, `accelerate`, `fpdf`, etc.\n","\n","3. **Run All Cells**\n","   - From the top menu: **Run → Run All**\n","   - Or run each section in order:\n","     1. Imports & Setup  \n","     2. Model Loading  \n","     3. Agent Definitions  \n","     4. Manga Generation Pipeline  \n","     5. PDF Creation\n","\n","4. **Output Location**\n","   - The final manga is saved at:\n","     ```bash\n","     /kaggle/working/final_manga_comic.pdf\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8. File Outputs\n","\n","- `final_manga_comic.pdf` – 5-page manga generated from user prompt  \n","- Individual panel images (PNG/JPG) stored in `/kaggle/working/`\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9. Limitations & Future Work\n","\n","- Image generation speed depends on GPU.\n","- Currently supports a fixed number of pages (e.g., 5).\n","- Future improvements:\n","  - Interactive UI for prompt input\n","  - Parameter control for style (chibi, realistic, etc.)\n","  - Multi-language support for dialogues\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"75cba543","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T12:00:50.463375Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T12:00:50.463135Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T12:02:01.573293Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T12:02:01.572506Z"},"papermill":{"duration":71.115888,"end_time":"2025-11-27T12:02:01.574786","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-27T12:00:50.458898","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting
